## Team submission

### General Comments
_Perfect!_

_Overall: 105/100%_

### Scheme
* Evaluation components will include:
    * (10/10%) Are the SCRUM meetings documented and all decisions documented properly and reflected in the Kanban Board and the issue tracker? Are decisions recorded in manner that provides for validation and traceability? 

    * (10/10%) Are progress (individual tasks), performance (how did the team members perform) and code reviews conducted and documented.
        * This should be the primary agenda of the end-of-sprint SCRUM meeting.
        * Each code task has been code reviewed explicitly
        * Each team member has been performance reviewed explicitly (identify them)
        * The review process (x2) is identified, and may include a checklist for guidance and normalizing the review activity.
        * The process should be clear and concise, allowing the opportunity for the individual to respond to specific problems. (a full page of criticism is too long.)
        * Issues that arise from code review are noted in the board.

    * (55/50%) Are the appropriate process elements established, followed and documented
        * (5/5%) pull request deadlines and process and other workflow elements (git workflow) described so a team member can follow them
        * (5/5%) code review standards clear and identified (possibly using a checklist) encapsulating principles from lecture materials (DRY, etc)
        * (5/5%) Current architecture and technology base (languages, modules, packages, tools) for project design described (including diagrams where needed) 
        * (10/10%) meetings conducted appropriate contributions, with roles, notes and all decisions documented
        * (25/25%) documentation, Kanban Board and issue tracker
        * labels and organization of issues in the tracker and cards on the board should be clear to the evaluator.
        * Completeness - the progress of tasks and issue status are clear from the board.
        * Labels have been modified for the team process. Labels help distinguish types of issues and tasks.
        * The board is clearly being used to update status and labels of tasks, and new cards identifying issues that arise are posted. 
        * (5/5%) individual task assignments are clear

    * (10/10%) Are any problems with the team progress, dynamics and process identified and documented along with status of these issues being clearly indicated
    
    * (20/20%) User stories
        * User stories are complete and good quality
        * Each user story generated two tasks that are in the board backlog or TODO columns 
        * The source/origin of the new tasks (e.g. link to their user story) are clearly documented on their kanban cards
