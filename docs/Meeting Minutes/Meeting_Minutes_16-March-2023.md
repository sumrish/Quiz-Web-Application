## Meeting Minutes Bullets

- Discussed current state of Kanban board and more specifically, the items on the backlog under 'ToDo'. The team wanted to reach an agreement on whether to finish those items first or pivot to committing to the quiz taking functionality which could not be delivered in the first sprint. 

- The team decided that while some backlog items can be tackled this sprint, emphasis must be on finishing up the quiz taking functionality end to end. New user stories were therefore put on the board (after due consideration over the 2 prior days). 

- The team also agreed on 2 deadlines prior to the assignment deadline, so that the team can better divide work and reach consensus on problems enroute to the agreed upon goal. These __PR deadlines were set to Monday, March 20th and Friday, March 24th__. 

- Heshani and Sumrish has agreed to work on the UI side of the quiz taking functionality which is currently available, non functionally, via the "Take Quiz" button on the /student page tab "Take a Quiz". They will further refine which of them does which part after further private discussion. 

- Adi has agreed to make the routing to admin page user story available for review soon. This item requires no dependencies on any other team members and is therefore suitable until the team has the UI set up for taking a quiz. 

- Mehadi and Majid have agreed to decide on which user stories (whether on backlog or newly created ones) to tackle for the first PR deadline. The backend developers (Adi, Mehadi, Majid) will further discuss and agree on immediately workable tasks.
